jQuery Airport
==============

Airport is a rather simple text effect plugin for Jquery. It emulates the style of those flickering information boards you sometimes find on airports and train stations.

How to use Airport
==================
Airtport is very easy to use. Create an element, give it an ID and throw airport on it. The values, moscow, berlin and stockholm, are the words it will flick through.

`$(  element  ).airport([ 'moscow', 'berlin', 'stockholm' ]);`
